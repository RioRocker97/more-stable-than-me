# Stable Diffusion on Line OA

  Bringing you the Famous Image Generation into Line OA !!!
  With Thai language prompt included !!
  Now you can easily input any desired text in thai and get what you want !
  Using [Huggingface's Diffuser](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) as the main pipeline


## TO-Do list

- Thai > Eng translator prompt KINDA WORK
- settings up HTTPS LATER

## Result
| Eng-Prompt | Tha-Prompt |

## Stable Diffusion
*Stable Diffusion was made possible thanks to a collaboration with [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) and builds upon our previous work:*

[Stable Diffusion](#stable-diffusion-v1) is a latent text-to-image diffusion
model.
Thanks to a generous compute donation from [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and support from [LAION](https://laion.ai/), we were able to train a Latent Diffusion Model on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database. 
Similar to Google's [Imagen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487), 
this model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts.
With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 10GB VRAM.
See [this section](#stable-diffusion-v1) below and the [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion).


### Stable Diffusion v1

Stable Diffusion v1 refers to a specific configuration of the model
architecture that uses a downsampling-factor 8 autoencoder with an 860M UNet
and CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder for the diffusion model. The model was pretrained on 256x256 images and 
then finetuned on 512x512 images.

*Note: Stable Diffusion v1 is a general text-to-image diffusion model and therefore mirrors biases and (mis-)conceptions that are present
in its training data. 
Details on the training procedure and data, as well as the intended use of the model can be found in the corresponding [model card](Stable_Diffusion_v1_Model_Card.md).*

While commercial use is permitted under the terms of the license, **we do not recommend using the provided weights for services or products without additional safety mechanisms and considerations**, since there are [known limitations and biases](Stable_Diffusion_v1_Model_Card.md#limitations-and-bias) of the weights, and research on safe and ethical deployment of general text-to-image models is an ongoing effort. **The weights are research artifacts and should be treated as such.**
